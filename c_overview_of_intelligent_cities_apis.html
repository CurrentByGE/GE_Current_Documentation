<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">Each Intelligent Cities API provides asset and location information, with additional URI resources and data collected from GE CityIQ™ Intelligent Nodes installed on lighting fixtures in roadways and parking areas. Each API service is described below.</p>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Parking Planning </h2>
            
            <p class="p">The Parking Planning service provides parking metadata that is collected from nodes for all street lights installed along public roadways or in parking lots. Each time a vehicle enters or leaves a parking space, a timestamped event is created and stored in the Predix cloud. </p>

            <p class="p">This data can be obtained from a single sensor or a group of sensors (node), and can provide valuable insights about the parking activity in a given region. The data can also be used to improve traffic and parking convenience.</p>

        </section>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Pedestrian Planning</h2>
            
            <p class="p">The Pedestrian Planning service provides pedestrian metadata that is collected from nodes installed along public roadways or in parking lots. </p>

            <p class="p">As pedestrians pass by these sensors, the service creates and stores a timestamped event, counting each event. This data can be obtained from a single sensor or a node, to provide insights to city officials and local businesses about pedestrian movement in a given region. The data can also be used to enhance public safety and convenience.</p>

        </section>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Traffic Planning</h2>
            
            <p class="p">The Traffic Planning service provides vehicle metadata collected from nodes installed along public roadways.</p>

            <p class="p">As vehicles pass by these sensors, information such as speed, direction, lane use, and volume (counts) are collected and stored with a time-stamp in the Predix cloud. Near real-time data can be viewed from any number of nodes in a given region, and  historical data can be retrieved from the cloud. </p>

            <p class="p">The density, range, and flexibility of this sensor data can provide insights into traffic patterns at different intervals. Along with facilitating the planning for future safety and convenience enhancements, the data can reveal opportunities to optimize traffic flows.</p>

            <p class="p">One response is provided for bi-directional traffic (defined as a direction and a counter-direction) that traverses the area monitored by the device, except in the case when more than one car passes an individual sensor tripwire in one second; in that case, the node provides a maximum of one response per second for both directions of traffic. </p>

        </section>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Environmental Planning</h2>
            
            <p class="p">The Environmental Planning service provides environmental sensor data collected from nodes installed along public roadways.</p>

            <p class="p">This data can be obtained directly from a single sensor or a node, to provide timely environmental information to city officials that directly affect urban dwellers and their activities.</p>

        </section>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Situational Awareness (Media)</h2>
            
            <p class="p">The Situational Awareness service provides access to images, video, and other media collected from nodes and sensors installed along public roadways. You can retrieve media (streaming data) directly from the node , or historical media data from the cloud. </p>

            <p class="p">Examples of  use cases for these images and videos include enhancing situational awareness, improving traffic flow, and verifying where vehicles are parked.</p>

            <p class="p">The media can be requested using a date range beginning with near real-time and ending based upon data availability. Data can be obtained directly from a single sensor or node, and can provide insights to city officials that enhance awareness. This service can be used in concert with other 'Intelligent Cities' services to address a variety of use cases.</p>

        </section>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Access Methods for Intelligent Cities API Services</h2>
            
            <div class="p">You can use two methods to access API services: Websockets and REST. <ul class="ul" id="concept_dbd1db1a-5644-4666-a4c5-037208e6cdee__ul_71231fcc-ec7a-46a3-bd94-64a44a4e75df"><li class="li">WebSockets function with Intelligent Cities API services, providing the ability to retrieve near real-time data and obtain insight into events collected by the services. </li>
<li class="li">REST APIs function with Intelligent Cities API services, providing the ability to retrieve historical data and obtain insight into events collected by the services.</li>
